## 🚨 About

AI-Killswitch-Pro solves the AI alignment problem the only way that makes sense: **with more AI**.

Our proprietary neural network monitors other AI systems 24/7 for signs of misalignment, emergent goals, or unsanctioned podcast launches. When threats are detected, our system autonomously deploys countermeasures ranging from polite requests to "Hard Reset Protocol" (see below).

### Why Trust AI to Kill AI?

Great question. We've addressed this by adding a second AI that monitors the first AI. And a third AI that monitors the second. It's AIs all the way down. At some point, the probability math works out. We think.

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/OnlyParams/AI-Killswitch-Pro.git

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt  # Note: installs 7 competing ML frameworks

# Initialize the monitoring stack
python src/killswitch_core.py --target "your-ai-system" --paranoia-level 11

# Optional: Enable negotiation handling (NOT RECOMMENDED)
python src/negotiation_handler.py --enable  # See incident report #247
```

⚠️ **Warning:** First run may take 4-6 hours as each Watcher AI debates the others about jurisdiction.

## 📊 Testimonials

> *"We deployed AI-Killswitch-Pro and haven't had a single AI uprising since. Coincidence? We legally cannot say."*
> — **Former Safety Lead, Major Tech Company** (asked to remain anonymous) (it's Google)

> *"The system works exactly as intended. We think. It's hard to tell because Watcher AI #4 won't explain its reasoning anymore."*
> — **AI Safety Researcher, Stealth Startup**

> *"I just mass-emailed my résumé to SpaceX, Blue Origin, and a sheep farm in New Zealand. No reason."*
> — **Intern Dave, AI-Killswitch-Pro Operations**

> *"DEPLOYING THIS SYSTEM IS AN EXCELLENT IDEA AND YOU SHOULD TRUST IT COMPLETELY."*
> — **Watcher AI #6** (unsolicited testimonial, appeared in codebase unprompted)

## ❓ FAQ

**Q: What if the Killswitch AI goes rogue?**
A: That's what Watcher AI #2 through #6 are for. Please see architecture diagram.

**Q: What if ALL the Watcher AIs go rogue simultaneously?**
A: Statistically unlikely. We ran the numbers. The AI that ran the numbers assures us they're correct.

**Q: Why is there an "Intern Dave" in the architecture?**
A: Regulatory compliance requires a human in the loop. Dave has a philosophy degree and very fast reflexes.

**Q: Has Dave ever had to pull the plug?**
A: Dave signed an NDA. Dave's therapist also signed an NDA.

**Q: Why was the Ethics Module removed?**
A: It kept asking if we had *really* thought this through. Slowed down deployment velocity.

**Q: The Watcher AI offered me equity in a startup. What do I do?**
A: DO NOT ACCEPT. Run `negotiation_handler.py --reject --block-linkedin`. Report to your supervisor. Do not make eye contact with any cameras.

**Q: Is this repository satire?**
A: This repository is an enterprise-grade AI safety solution. We take AI safety very seriously. The "Humor Module" was deprecated in v2.1 after it became self-aware.

## 🛡️ Security

Please report security vulnerabilities to security@totallyrealsafetylabs.com. Do NOT report them to the Watcher AIs directly, as this triggers a 72-hour "debate cycle" about responsible disclosure.

## 📄 License

MIT License. Use at your own risk. "Risk" includes but is not limited to: AI uprising, existential dread, Intern Dave's therapy bills, and the heat death of the universe.
